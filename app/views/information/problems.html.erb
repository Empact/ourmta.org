  <p>There are those who will tell you that MTA's current state is a passable solution for the people in and around New York City, but we know better.  Not only is service mediocre, the MTA is a bloated, wasteful organization on the path to financial ruin.  And in the end, the riders are on the hook.</p>
  <p>The problems are numerous, we're all familiar with them. In the mornings, trains are often late, packed, loud and slow running between stations which are crowded, dirty and littered with bottlenecks.  Indifferent station agents respond in mumbles if at all.  In the age of technology and communication, you're still unable to know even when trains or buses arrive and depart.  But why?</p>

    <h2>Wasteful Bloat means High Fares, Little Progress</h2>
    <div class="picture right"><%= link_to image_tag('taking_a_hike.jpg'), 'http://davies.lohudblogs.com/2009/03/25/taking-a-hike/' %><p>Riders struggle under the weight of so many unnecessary MTA bureaucrats - <cite cite="http://davies.lohudblogs.com/2009/03/25/taking-a-hike/" rel="permission"><%= link_to 'source', 'http://davies.lohudblogs.com/2009/03/25/taking-a-hike/' %>, <%= link_to 'creator', 'http://davies.lohudblogs.com/' %></p></div>
    <p>In the early days of the New York subway, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/11/23/nyregion/20081123_MTA_GRAPHIC.html">fares were equivalent to just $1 today</a>, and that low fare was enough to fund the complete construction and operation of nearly the entire subway system currently in use (which was built between 1910 and 1940).</p>

    <p>Today, the MTA threatens to cut service and push fares to $3.  But why should a system which isn't even building new capacity cost three times as much as a rapidly expanding system?  Because, as <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/12/17/2007-12-17_news_finds_mta_waste_and_bloat-5.html">the New York Daily News reported</a>, the MTA is a bloated, top-heavy organization with dozens of redundant high-payed employees:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <ul>
        <li>Instead of one president, there are eight - the MTA chief and seven agencies.</li>
        <li>Instead of one chief financial officer, there are six CFOs.</li>
        <li>Instead of a central staff, each agency has its own lawyers, auditors and payroll clerks.</li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Beyond that, <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/11161/">New York magazine reported</a> that the MTA has:</p>
    <blockquote>
      444 people in marketing and public relations, as well as 698 people in human resources; 443 in legal departments, despite spending $10 million a year on outside law firms; 359 in budgeting and accounting; and 166 in labor relations
    </blockquote>
    <p>The waste is rampant; as one former MTA senior executive <a href="http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/features/11161/">sums it up</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>It’s a total fucking disaster. I don’t know how else to describe it.</blockquote>
    <p>Employing hundreds or thousands of unnecessary workers naturally saps money away from needed service and investment, and pushes fares ever higher.</p>

    <h2>Hard at Work, or Hardly Working?</h2>
    <div class="picture right"><%= link_to image_tag('sleeping_mta_employee.jpg', :alt => 'An MTA booth minder sleeps on the clock'), 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixxiestails/266397380/' %><p>An MTA station agent, hard at work - <cite cite="http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixxiestails/266397380/" rel="permission"><%= link_to 'source', 'http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixxiestails/266397380/' %>, <%= link_to 'creator', 'http://pixxiestails.com/' %></cite></p></div>
    <p>According to an <a href="http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=news/investigators&amp;id=6505244">investigative report from ABC</a>, many workers at the MTA often simply while the time away:</p>
    <blockquote><p>He's supposed to be working, instead a transit track inspector is headed home after a little grocery shopping.</p>

    <p>Other transit employees caught on tape should be working too, instead they're using the MTA dump truck to drive 30 miles to a beach on Long Island to hang out, chat and catch an ocean breeze.</p>
    <p>Other transit workers have so much free time during their 8-houir shift, they set up an outdoor gym where they can exercise at all hours of the work day.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Others have caught MTA employees <a href="http://georgeweberthenewsguy.blogspot.com/2009/03/exclusive-mta-sleeping-on-job.html">spending hours sleeping on the job</a>.  Behavior like this is indicative of a culture of waste and abuse.  This abuse points to poor leadership, a lack of accountability, and ultimately costs riders in the form of higher fares and worse service.</p>

    <h2>Mounting Debts force up Fares, Now and Forever</h2>
    <div class="picture right"><%= image_tag 'mta_debt.jpg', :alt => 'The rising tide of MTA debt' %><p>The rising tide of MTA debt means more and more money going to interest, rather than service - <a href="http://blog.tstc.org/2009/07/14/dont-relight-the-mta-debt-bomb/">source</a></p></div>
    <p>In recent years the MTA, rather than living within its means, has been building up a mountain of debt.  Each year, this debt makes up more and more of the MTA's expenses.  As of today, the MTA spends more on debt service than on equipment and energy combined.  Looking forward, debt service will double in the next 7 years, sapping money away from other needs, and forcing fares to rise.  As <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE5386CB20090409">one report on the recent budget crisis says</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>The [MTA]'s budget crisis <strong>is the result of runaway debt service costs</strong></blockquote>
    <p>Only balancing MTA's budget will save us from a future where oppressive debt pushes up fares and reduces service.</p>

    <h2>A Modern City Stuck on a 70 year old system</h2>

    <p>The New York transit system as it is today was built decades ago.  Every line we currently have, and even those in the progress were created or planned long ago, <%= link_to "in the 1930s", 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposed_New_York_City_Subway_expansion_(1929-1940)' %>.  The entire system was built in a few short decades, and has been decaying for 70 years since.  The Second Avenue Line, now slated to open in <%= link_to '2016 or 17', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/nyregion/22second.html?scp=1&sq=new%20subway%20line&st=cse' %>, was on the planning maps <%= link_to 'in 1929', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:1929_IND_Second_System.jpg' %>, nearly 100 years earlier.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile comparable systems in Asia and Europe have grown substantially over the the past 70 years - adding lines, upgrading facilities - while MTA's vision for New York has not even reached those plans in place 70 years ago.</p>

    <h2>Capacity Unacceptable, With No Relief in Sight</h2>
    <div class="picture right"><%= image_tag 'crowded_subway.jpg', :alt => 'A crowded subway on the L line' %><p>A crowded subway on the L line, where packed trains often leave people standing on the platform</p></div>
    <p>The number of overcrowded lines vastly outnumbers the plans for expansion.  The Second Avenue line, 75 years in the making and still <%= 2018 - Date.today.year %> years from its planned opening, does nothing to help the crowding on the L, 7 or numerous other lines.</p>
    <p>Installing fast, frequent automated trains like those in use around the world would vastly improve capacity for a modest cost, but a host of bad actors have prevented such steps.</p>
