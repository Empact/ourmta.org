  <h1>Our Stagnating System</h1>
  <p>There are those who will tell you that MTA's current state is a passable solution for the people in and around New York City, but we know better.</p>

  <h2>Inconvenience and Indifference Abound</h2>
  <p>The problems are numerous, we're all familiar with them.  In the mornings, trains are late, packed, loud and slow running (and often stopping) between stations which are crowded, dirty and littered with bottlenecks.  Indifferent station agents respond in mumbles if at all.  In the internet age, you're unable to know even when trains might arrive.  Service change notices hang everywhere, notifying you of more annoyances, while "explaining" your inconvenience with a simple "We are performing track maintenance."</p>

  <h2>A Modern City Living on an 70 year old system</h2>
  <p>The system, as it is, was built decades ago.  Every line we currently have, and even those in progress were planned long ago, in the 1920's.  The entire system was built in a few decades, and has been decaying for 70 years since.  The Second Avenue Line, now slated to open in 2015, was on the planning maps in 1929, nearly 100 years earlier.</p>

  <p>While comparable systems in Asia and Europe have grown substantially over the the past 70 years - adding lines, upgrading facilities - the MTA has left New York with essentially the same system it had 70 years ago.</p>

  <h2>Needed Expansion Unmet</h2>
  <%= link_to image_tag('subway_map_with_roads.png'), 'http://www.onnyturf.com/subway/', :style => 'float:right' %>
  <p>While you wouldn't know from reading the MTA's subway maps, large areas of all boroughs are unserved by the subways.  Not only is the Second Avenue line sorely needed, 100  years later, but there are areas farther east and west whose substantial population is avenues away from the nearest station.</p>

  <h2>Capacity Unacceptable, With No Relief in Sight</h2>
  <p>The number of overcrowded lines vastly outnumbers the plans for expansion.  The Second Avenue line, 75 years in the making and still <%= 2015 - Date.today.year %> years from its planned opening, does nothing to help the crowding on the L, 7 or numerous other lines.</p>
