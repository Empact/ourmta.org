  <h2>Trains without Waiting</h2>

  <p>Imagine arriving at the station, only to have a train appear moments later, every single day.  Imagine never again hearing the words "delayed because of train traffic ahead of us".</p>
  <p>Paris' newest line runs so frequently that the arrival time is shown in seconds, rather than minutes.  Because this line is stocked with state-of-the-art driverless trains, the trains run like clockwork, as little as a minute apart throughout the day and night.</p>
  <p>Not only does this save tremendously on wait times, but because automated systems are so reliable, you may never in your life experience a delay on such a train.  Crucially, computer-driven trains are also safer, as the driver never falls asleep or fails to pay attention, and platform-side doors make for safer, quieter, more pleasant stations.</p>

  <p>Finally, running the trains just one minute apart means that the system has far more capacity for riders.  Crowded trains suddenly aren't crowded anymore when you have many more trains running smoothly over the same lines.</p>

  <h2>Breathtaking Stations</h2>

  <p>While the stations of the subway are now often dirty, ugly,  marginally welcoming places, this was not always the case.  New York City once had the imagination to build stations which were beautiful as well as practical.  <%= link_to 'The City Hall station', 'http://www.nycsubway.org/perl/stations?5:979' %> remains the most impressive subway station in New York, and yet it hasn't been used since the 1945.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, across the country and across the world, city after city has shown what beautiful places the subway stations can be.  With our vision of the MTA, we can once again see stations which are inspire as well as serve.</p>

  <h2>More Lines Where You Need Them</h2>
  <div class="picture right"><%= link_to image_tag('Tokyo_metro_history_map.gif', :alt => 'Time-lapse rendering of Tokyo Metro lines, 1927 - 2008', :size => '485x364'), 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway' %><p>Tokyo Metro lines, 1927 - 2008; the bulk of Tokyo's subway development has occurred in the last 60 years, a time when New York's system has stagnated  - <cite cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tokyo_metro_history_map.gif" rel="gfdl"><%= link_to 'source', 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tokyo_metro_history_map.gif' %></cite></p></div>
  <p>While the MTA has stagnated since 1940, foreign systems have been building out at a rapid pace, connecting and serving more and more of their citizenry.  Tokyo's system, for example, has been built from nearly nothing starting in the 50s, and now serves twice as many riders as the New York system.</p>
  <p>If New York were to build at a fraction the pace, we could bring direct, pleasant uncrowded access for far more riders to nearly anywhere in the area.</p>

  <h2>Service with a smile</h2>

  <p>In 2008, four young New Yorkers took to the subway in a sort of protest against the indifference of the current MTA.  They took matters into their own hands, patrolling the subway, distributing snacks, hand sanitizer and information, doing everything they could to improve the subway environment.</p>
  <p>Now, this was performance art, but they shine a light on the disturbing gap between what MTA customer service is, and what it could be.  Helpful, cheerful, knowledgeable agents would go a long way towards brightening the environment of the subways, trains and busses, and could be achieved easily:</p>
  <p>Stores often hire "secret shoppers" to test the shopping experience in their stores.  The MTA could do this just as well, to ensure that its own workers are always polite and helpful.  The end result would be a brighter, smoother-running New York transit system.</p>
