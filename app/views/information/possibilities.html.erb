<h1>What's Possible When MTA is Fixed?</h1>

<p>To really understand how far behind MTA is, and what's possible when MTA is fixed, it's helpful to look to what other, more functional systems have to offer.  In this case, Paris' Metro, a system with less than 1/3 the tracks of the New York Subway, serving a city 1/4 the population of New York but with 90% of its ridership, shows what's possible.</p>

<h2>Truly Fast, Frequent, Non-stop Service</h2>
<p>Imagine arriving at the station, only to have a train appear moments later.  Imagine never again hearing those words "delayed because of train traffic ahead of us".  Paris' newest line, built just 10 years ago, is a state-of-art driverless train.  Because computers can drive the train with the utmost precision, the trains run as little as a minute and 15 seconds apart.  Not only does this save on wait times, but because automated systems are so reliable, you may never in your life experience a delay on such a train.  Imagine never again needing to pause in the stations or in the tunnels, because your train is always planning ahead.</p>

<p>And running the trains just 85 seconds apart means that the system has far more capacity for ridership.  Crowded trains suddenly aren't crowded anymore when you have four times the capacity running over the same lines.</p> 

<h2>Modern, Spacious, High-capacity Trains</h2>
<p>The trains of Paris show other possibilities.  For example, several of their lines run trains which as continuously connected, meaning you can freely walk from train car to train car.  This helps prevent crowding both because the previously wasted space between the trains is available for people, but also because riders can move to the less crowded sections of the train, rather than being bottled up in a single car.  With these systems, there's no more unnecessary crowding.</p>

  <h2>More service to more places</h2>

  <p>While the MTA has stagnated, foreign systems have been building out at a rapid pace, connecting and serving more and more of their citizenry.  Tokyo's system, for example, has been built from nearly nothing starting in the 50s, and now serves twice as many riders as the New York system.</p>
